Universal IC Tester for Analog and Digital ICs

This project presents a low-cost, portable IC tester using an Arduino UNO to validate both digital logic ICs and analog ICs.
The system checks the functionality of common ICs such as logic gates (NAND, NOR, AND, OR, XOR, XNOR) and analog devices like the LM741 Op-Amp, BJT, and JFET, providing quick verification for education, R&D, and troubleshooting.

Key Features

Tests both digital ICs (7400, 7402, 7408, 7432, 7486, 747266) and analog ICs (LM741 Op-Amp, BJT, JFET).

LED indicators show pass/fail results instantly.

Serial Monitor output provides detailed test results.

Portable, low-cost, and easy to use for students and engineers.

System Overview

Hardware Setup

Arduino UNO as the controller.

LEDs and resistors for visual indication.

Breadboard and jumper wires for quick prototyping.

IC Testing Method

For digital ICs, Arduino applies all possible input combinations and compares outputs with truth tables.

For analog ICs, Arduino measures Op-Amp output voltages via analog pins and validates threshold values.

Result Indication

Green LED lights up if the IC works correctly.

Serial Monitor displays detailed pass/fail outputs for each test.

Hardware Used

Arduino UNO

Breadboard

Resistors

LEDs (Red, Green)

Jumper wires

Digital ICs (7400 series)

LM741 Operational Amplifier

Software & Tools

Arduino IDE

C/C++ code for IC testing

Serial Monitor for result display

Applications

Educational tool for learning digital and analog circuits

R&D labs for IC validation

Circuit debugging in engineering projects

Limitations

Limited to supported ICs (basic gates and LM741 Op-Amp).

Tests only one gate per IC, assuming others are functional.

Conclusion

The Universal IC Tester provides a simple and efficient solution to test the functionality of both digital and analog ICs.
Its portability and low cost make it highly suitable for students, researchers, and engineers in academic and practical environments.

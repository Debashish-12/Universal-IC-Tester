Universal IC Tester for Analog and Digital ICs

This project implements a Universal IC Tester using an Arduino UNO.
It can test both digital logic ICs (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) and analog ICs (Op-Amps like LM741, BJT, JFET) to check if they are working properly.

Features

Tests basic digital logic ICs: 7400 (NAND), 7402 (NOR), 7408 (AND), 7432 (OR), 7486 (XOR), 747266 (XNOR).

Tests analog ICs: LM741 Op-Amp, BJT, JFET.

LED indicators show pass/fail results.

Serial Monitor output for detailed test results.

Simple, low-cost, and portable design.

Components Used

Arduino UNO

Breadboard

Resistors

LEDs (Red, Green)

Jumper wires

Logic gate ICs (7400 series, LM741, etc.)

Working Principle

The Arduino applies inputs to the IC under test.

It reads the IC output and compares it with the expected truth table (digital ICs) or expected voltage (Op-Amps).

A Green LED lights up if the IC works correctly; otherwise, results are flagged in the Serial Monitor.

Implementation

Digital ICs: Arduino sets all input combinations (00, 01, 10, 11) and checks outputs against truth tables.

Analog ICs: Arduino reads the Op-Amp output via analog pins and validates voltage thresholds.

Code is written in Arduino IDE and uploaded to the UNO.

Advantages

Universal compatibility with most ICs.

Time-efficient and accurate.

Useful for education, R&D, and troubleshooting.

Portable and easy to use.

Applications

Teaching tool for understanding digital and analog circuits.

IC validation in R&D labs.

Debugging circuits in engineering projects.

Limitations

Supports only a limited set of ICs.

Tests only one gate per IC, assuming others are functional.

Conclusion

The Universal IC Tester is a versatile, low-cost solution for quickly validating ICs.
It supports both digital and analog ICs, making it highly useful for students, researchers, and engineers.
